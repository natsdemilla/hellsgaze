You wake up in the middle of the dirtiest hospital you have ever seen, surrounded by wounded and crazy-looking strangers and they all wait in a line that you have just skipped.
This is a terrible start, you think to yourself, ready to get out of the way, when someone speaks to you: "Hello, welcome to Hell. My name's Angie, how may I help you?". 
Did she say "Hell"? I'm sure you misunderstood, why don't you ask again?
*line_break
"What?"
*line_break
Very smooth, she will probably be impressed. The girl smiles sweetly at you and repeats: "Welcome to Hell."

*page_break
She waits for a reaction, anything that proves you're not brain dead.
*fake_choice
  #I can't possibly be in Hell!
    You guarantee Angie that she must be mistaken, to what she responds with a sigh: "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but God makes no mistakes. If you're here, you should be here."
    *set heaven +1
  #...What?
    You can't seem to muster anything cohesively, so you babble another 'what', that earns you Angie's pity. "Are you alright?"
  #I knew I'd come here eventually, but...
    You don't know how or when it happened, but there is no doubt you're in the right place. You shrug and tell her that.
    *set heaven -1

This girl is the only beautiful thing around here. Everything else is nasty: the walls are covered in blood, mold and other things that don't feel safe to identify. It is so hot in here it makes you shiver as if it was cold.
