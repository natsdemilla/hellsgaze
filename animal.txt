The receptionist hands you a few papers and says: "Please, before we continue, fill out those forms and then go to the end of the line". This much bureaucracy: you must trully be in Hell.
You can't blame her for not paying attention to your problems. She probably hears that all of the time, after all. Let's take a look at the paperwork...
*page_break

The first question is easy enough: are you male or female?
*choice
	#Male
		*set gender "male"
		*set he "he"
		*set him "him"
		*set his "his"
		*set man "man"
		*set boy "boy"
		*set sir "sir"
		*set mr "Mr."
		*set nickname "boy scout"
		*set handsome "handsome"
		*goto gender_show
		
	#Female
		*set gender "female"
		*set he "she"
		*set him "her"
		*set his "her"
		*set man "woman"
		*set boy "girl"
		*set sir "ma'am"
		*set mr "Ms."
		*set nickname "girly"
		*set handsome "beautiful"
		*goto gender_show
		
*label gender_show

So you are a ${man}, ${sir}? I would never have guessed!

*label name
	
"What is your name?"

*if (gender="male")
	*goto male_name

*if (gender="female")
	*goto female_name
	*label male_name

*fake_choice
	#Paul

	#Peter
		*set name "Peter"
	#James
		*set name "James"
	#David
		*set name "David"
	#Let me input my name
		*input_text name
		
*goto  surname

*label female_name

*fake_Choice
	#Mary
		*set name "Mary"
	#Madeleine
		*set name "Madeleine"
	#Esther
		*set name "Esther"
	#Delilah
		*set name "Delilah"
	#Let me input my own name
		*input_text name

*goto surname

*label surname

What is your surname?

*fake_choice
	#Smith
		*set surname "Smith"
	#Sanchez
		*set surname "Sanchez"
	#Hart
		*set surname "Hart"
	#Lee
		*set surname "Lee"
	#Let me input my own name
		*input_text surname

*goto hello_name

*label hello_name
"${mr} ${name} ${surname}. It has a nice ring to it."
